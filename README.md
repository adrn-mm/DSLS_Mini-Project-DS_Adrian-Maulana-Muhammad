##### Mini Project Data Science DSLS 2023 by Adrian Maulana Muhammad

# Project Description
Select a use case to serve as your portfolio using Waze data. Some options are as follows, but you are also encouraged to explore other use cases that align with your interests:
- Forecasting (e.g. predicting weekend traffic in Bogor City)
- Prediction (e.g. traffic flow prediction, congestion prediction)
- Clustering (e.g. clustering roads based on delay time)

Conduct modeling using various algorithms, then perform hyperparameter tuning and evaluate the performance of your model based on metrics you have learned.
